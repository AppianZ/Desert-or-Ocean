This is a personal exercise project.(,,• ₃ •,,)<br/>
Maybe it's nonsense,<br/>
but it may be a significant step to me to be a qualified engineer.<br/><br/>

The facts tell me how stupid I am to be at a standstill.<br/>
I need to debug myself.(⊙﹏⊙)

No one like loneliness,just dislike disappointment.<br/>
Even thought I am used to be.(,,•́ . •̀,,)
